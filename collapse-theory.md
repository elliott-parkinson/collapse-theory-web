# 🧩 Collapse Theory Manifesto  
## *Games You Own. Mechanics That Matter.*

At Collapse Theory, we believe in a simple truth:  
**When you buy a game, it should be yours. Forever.**

No subscriptions. No DRM traps. No disappearing libraries.  
Just timeless gameplay, built to last — and built to belong to you.

## 🎮 Why We Exist

We’re here to revive what the industry forgot:

- **Mechanics-first design** that rewards mastery, not monetization  
- **Puzzle games with soul**, not just retention metrics  
- **Visual polish with modular depth**, not shallow spectacle  

We grew up on *Collapse*, *Bejeweled*, and *Tetris*.  
They weren’t just games — they were rituals.  
And they respected your time, your skill, and your ownership.

## 🛡️ Our Promise to Players

- **Buy once, play forever** — no online checks, no platform lock-in  
- **No ads, no loot boxes, no psychological traps**  
- **Playable offline, mod-friendly, and built for longevity**  
- **Cross-platform by design** — mobile, desktop, tablet, console  

When you buy a Collapse Theory game, it’s not a license.  
It’s a **gift to your future self**.

## 🧠 Our Design Philosophy

- Every mechanic earns its place  
- Every asset is modular and reusable  
- Every UI element is crafted for clarity and delight  
- Every game is a **creative system**, not a content treadmill  

We don’t chase trends. We build tools for timeless play.

## 🧙‍♀️ Join the Theory

Collapse Theory isn’t just a studio — it’s a movement.  
A return to games that respect the player.  
A stand against disposable design.

If you believe games should be owned, not rented…  
If you crave mechanics that challenge, not manipulate…  
If you want to build something that lasts…

**You’re one of us.**
